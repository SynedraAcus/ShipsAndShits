CONFLICT CALL

Conflict must be initialised, then shown, then you may get results. The following is a complete run-through:

    $ init_conflict(u'0З1С1Д')
    # This line initialises everything for a conflict. The only argument is deck-defining line.
    # The syntax is digit-suit letter-digit-suit letter, et cetera et cetera. Usable letters are ЗСДИ
    # As this is a python line, don't forget that dollar sign in the beginning!

    show screen conf
    # This line actually starts conflict. Careful: it's 'show screen', not 'call screen' as in previous version

    "Launching conflict"
    # There must be at least one line of text between showing screen and reading results
    #
    if ret == 'Defeat':
        "Returned defeat"
        jump failure
    #Below are victory variants. The game returns FULL suit name (unicode, don't forget the letter u before the line)
    elif ret == u'Знания':
        jump success_knowledge
    elif ret == u'Сила':
        jump success_force
